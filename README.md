# Diabetes Prediction

Diabetes is a condition that impairs the body's ability to process blood glucose, otherwise known as blood sugar. In the United States, the estimated number of people over 18 years of age with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes is 30.2 million. The figure represents between 27.9 and 32.7 percent of the population. Without ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a buildup of sugars in the blood, which can increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease. Different kinds of diabetes can occur, and managing the condition depends on the type. Not all forms of diabetes stem from a person being overweight or leading an inactive lifestyle. In fact, some are present from childhood.

## Algorithm Used

Supprot Vector Machine algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well as regression predictive problems. However, it is mainly used for classification predictive problems in industry.

## Four Steps involved in the model

01. Begin by collecting Diabetes data and understanding the content of the dataset
02. Preprocess data
03. Train - Test data
04. Feed a Supprot Vector Machine model after determining data subset to be satisfactory

## Based on above model we can predict whether a person is Diabetec or Not
